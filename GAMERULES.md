# Money Game Rules

Your boss has been mad at your team for overspending their budget during the last year, so much so
that they cut your teams size to just 2 employees... you and D(AI)ve.
They have given your team a very strict budget for a new software development project,
and considering how many cuts have happened last time, you're pretty sure your head is next on the chopping block if you go over the budget.

You and D(AI)ve are both asked to manage the engineering teams this year, you have 3 levels of engineers:
    - Senior engineers, that cost 13 euros an hour
    - Junior engineers, that cost 6 euros an hour
    - Interns, that cost 3 euros an hour

They are all contractors you can pull in from other teams for an hour, and you know that the budget is not going to be enough for the scale of the project,
so your only choice is to throw D(ai)ve under the bus... It's fine... You're pretty sure he's just one of those new fancy AI models anyway.

You and D(ai)ve swap places every hour, since your team can only have one extra employee at a time.
